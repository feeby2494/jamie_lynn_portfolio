At a pic-n-pull I tried to test fit the oem 7th gen muffler onto an 8th gen. It was pretty close, except the 7th gen had a smaller diameter and the bolt hole on the flange would need to be drilled out a little more. Howerver, the OBX unit will have a bigger diameter and flange! This should work!",

Over here in the Wild West, ruled by middleaged men who drive like they just got their license yesterday in their Prenium EuroTrash, the roads are dysfunctional with so many unskilled drivers you won't want to drive anywhere, but you have to drive everywhere, because everything is so far away. But in the midst of so many crazy wild drivers, there's a group of bad *ss MoFos, who modify their cars and love diversity. In fact, Texas is perfect for car culture, no matter what you're into! Giant lifted Texas-style trucks to small Honda hatchbacks, Modern Muscell to Classic cars, Exotic to heavily modified, to clean, OEM, and Restored beuties. Texas has everything and everyone for your car projects, except MOUNTIANS!!!! AGHH!!!",
